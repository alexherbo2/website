> [Tsukihi Araragi][]: Karen’s out.

> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Don’t get into any trouble, you two.

> [Tsukihi Araragi][]: I resent that.  We aren’t planning anything.
> You’re always this way.  You always treat us like children.
> You worry too much.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: I’m not worried.  I just don’t trust you.
>
> [Tsukihi Araragi][]: Aren’t those the same thing?

>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Well, it sounds right when you put it like that.
>
> [Tsukihi Araragi][]: It isn’t that fights per se are wrong.
> It’s that people simply don’t know the proper way to fight.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: But the fights you two get involved with are always violent.
> I refuse to believe that’s the right way to fight.

> But what about it?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Well, it’s really hard to tell my family about it, you know?
> But I’m not sure if it’s something I can hide forever.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: I don’t think you have to be overly honest and confess.
> Even though they are your family, it’s natural that you keep a secret or two from them.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Hachikuji?
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: For one thing, sharing your secret with someone means you involve them in your problems.
> It may make things easier for you by telling them, but your family could end up suffering for it.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: That’s true, isn’t it?
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Right now, what you need is the courage to keep your secret to yourself!

> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Right now, what you need is the courage to keep your secret to yourself!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: That sounds very wise.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Well, I’m just making it sound positive by adding the word “courage” to it.
> Really, it’s just a normal secret.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: That sounds very honest!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: You can make almost anything sound positive by adding the word “courage”.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: That can’t be right.
> I refuse to believe that Japanese is structured that way.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Shall I demonstrate?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Bring it.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: If you can satisfy me, I’ll do a handstand, right here.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: A handstand?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Yes…
> Like getting on your knees to bow, but better.
> And if you can’t satisfy me, then you have to do a handstand here, wearing your skirt!
> Your kiddy panties will be exposed to public view, until I allow you to stop!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Very well.
> I accept your challenge.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: I praise your guts, if nothing else.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: You’re like a phoenix to the flame, Araragi.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: No, I’m nothing as cool as that.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: We’ll start with warm-ups.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji]’s eyes: Courage Series
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: The courage to lie to your lover.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi]’s introspection: Not bad…
> All you’re doing is simply lying, but tacking “courage” onto it makes it sound like you’re lying for your lover’s sake.
> Even though she hasn’t said anything suggesting that.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: The courage to betray your comrades.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: What?!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi]’s introspection: Amazing…
> The end result is that you’ve betrayed your comrades.
> But that gives the impression that you’ve somehow protected them.
> Even though she hasn’t said anything suggesting that!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: The courage to be a lazy bum.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Wh-What?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi]’s introspection: It really can do anything!
> You’re just meaninglessly whiling away your life,
> but that makes it sound like you’ve positioned yourself in poverty,
> all for some greater goal.
> Even though she hasn’t said anything, anything at all, suggesting that!
> B-But I cannot admit defeat here!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: The courage to admit defeat.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi]’s introspection: I admit my defeat!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: I was lulled by the awesomeness of the words into admitting my own defeat!
> And all I did was admit defeat…
> Japanese is really simple!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Now, Araragi.
> Show me something better than getting on your knees to bow.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Very well…
> I have the courage to do a handstand!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Seeing someone your age doing a handstand is actually kind of pathetic…
> You can stop.
> I said you could stop, Araragi.
> Actually, please stop, Araragi.
> I’m embarrassed just being next to you.
> Why continue your handstand, as if it were a promise made in response to a friend’s last request?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Well, you know…
> I was just thinking that if I stood on my hands, from this angle, I can see your panties.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Araragi, you are a pervert!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: The courage to accept the label of pervert!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: So cool!
> So cool, I’m tempted to have the courage to show you my panties as you wish!
> Especially the way you continue, even after I kicked you in the face!
> I can’t believe the technology I developed has now been turned against me…
> So ironic.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: You grew overconfident, Hachikuji!
> I have mastered your secret technique!
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Oh, no.
> I may have created a monster!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: But I do apologize for calling them kiddy panties.
> I never expected you’d be wearing semi-transparent black panties.
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: What are you saying?
> Take a closer look!
> Don’t say that!
> It’ll ruin my image!
> I’ve responded to consumer demand, and am wearing kiddy panties!
> They have a bunny on them, right?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: I can’t see any bunnies.
> If you want me to see them, you have to make it easier.

> We were talking about the need to keep the apparitions a secret, right?
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: You see, Mr. Araragi, in a way, the apparitions are what’s behind the curtain.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Behind the curtain?
>
> [Mayoi Hachikuji][]: Normally, you only need to see what’s happening on stage.

> I’ll be “right” if I defeat you, correct?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: That way of thinking is dangerous.

>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: What did I say?
>
> [Karen Araragi][]: About Tsukihi and me.
> That we’re right, but not strong.

> You went on and on and on about it!

> Yeah, that’s right.  You’re right, but you’re not strong.
>
> [Karen Araragi][]: But I am strong!  I’m stronger than you at least.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: There’s no point in having physical strength alone.
> The real deal needs to have mental strength and will.
> You say you’ll never forgive Kaiki.
> How much of those feelings are yours alone?
> You two always act for the sake of others.
> But if you act for another’s sake,

>
> [Karen Araragi][]: That’s not it!  We’re doing what we think is right!
> The others are just the reason why!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Don’t make me laugh!
> How can you call it justice if you need others to give you a reason?
> You’re using others!  What makes you think that’s okay?
> What you do is not just.  You’re not friends of justice!
> You’re just kids pretending to be heroes of justice!
> Just impostors.
> You aren’t targeting the root of all evil, you’re just scratching the surface!
> Or am I wrong?
>
> [Karen Araragi][]: You are!
> Don’t act as if you know everything!
> Tsubasa would understand it.
> She knows everything!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: She doesn’t know everything.
> She just knows what she knows.
> It’s not self-sacrifice.
> If you don’t know when to be satisfied, it’s still way too early to use big words like justice.
> It’s unpleasant.
>
> [Karen Araragi][]: What’s wrong with acting for others?
> What’s wrong with sacrificing myself?
> What’s wrong…  What’s wrong with us being impostors?!
> Did we ever cause you trouble, or what?!
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: You caused me a lot of trouble, all the time.

> Scene: The questioning ends
>
> [Tsubasa Hanekawa][]: Oh, I get it now.
> Sorry, I didn’t know you preferred salad with dressing.
> So that’s why you had such a weird look on your face.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: No, I was unaware that someone who didn’t like salad dressing existed.
> This is the first time I’ve seen someone serve plain fried eggs, or bread with nothing else on the table.
> Are you not too fond of adding flavor to your food?
> Do you like the natural taste of the ingredients?
>
> [Tsubasa Hanekawa][]: Not really.
> But food’s tasty even without any flavoring, isn’t it?
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: So it’s settled then.
>
> [Tsubasa Hanekawa][]: Huh?  I’m just saying it doesn’t really make a difference if there’s any flavoring or not.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: I suppose this is what they call “letting the cat out of the bag”.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara]’s thoughts: The cat’s been out of the bag for quite a while now.

> [Tsubasa Hanekawa][]: Thanks for the food.

> […]
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: I fully take back what I said about the two of us having similar tastes.
> You’re like the exact opposite of someone with an unbalanced diet.
> That isn’t to say that you’re not picky, either.
>
> [Tsubasa Hanekawa][]: I’m sorry, Senjougahara.
> I still don’t really get what you’re trying to tell me.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: A household taste, huh?
> But I guess that’s off too.
> You just accept all kinds of flavors, I guess?
> You’re fine with anything as long as it’s edible and nutritious.
> Or does nutrition not matter as long as it accumulates in your stomach?
>
> [Tsubasa Hanekawa][]: Stop making it sound like I’m a soldier or something.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: But you _do_ have a sense of taste.
> If you’re not doing this because you like how the ingredients taste, then maybe it just shows how tolerant you are.
> But, y’know, Hanekawa,
> I think there’s something wrong with that lifestyle.
> And I’m not just talking about your diet, either.
> You just… accept anything and everything.
> Don’t you think having things you hate is just as important as having things you like?
> And yet you accept anything and everything.
> That might be why you accept me, and also why you accept Araragi.
> That’s how it makes me feel.
>
> [Tsubasa Hanekawa]’s thoughts:
> - Did we change the subject?
> - Did we stray from the subject?
> - Did the subject get much wider?
> - No, that’s not it.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: Our tastes aren’t similar, are they?
> It’s just that you like everything, including the stuff I like.
> Well, maybe it’s not correct to say that you have “tastes”.
>
> [Tsubasa Hanekawa]’s thoughts: Some things are better left unsaid.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: I mean, if you like anything and everything, that means they’re all the same to you.

>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Oh, that wish.

> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Won’t a wish not come true if you tell someone?
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Huh?  What do you mean?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: When you go on New Year’s shrine visits, for example, you’re not supposed to tell others what you wished for.
> They say they won’t come true if you do.
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Wait, why do wishes not come true if you tell others about them?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Isn’t it because words aren’t trustworthy?
> The moment you speak something, it gets disconnected from your feelings.
> Words are all lies.  They’re a sham.

> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Sengoku.
> You said that you didn’t want to be a god, right?
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: I did.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: That you didn’t become one because you wanted to.
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: I did.  What of it?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: In that case…
> Do you want to be a manga artist?

>
> Scene: Red
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: You saw it, didn’t you?!
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Yeah, I did.
> I saw it.
> I put a 10 yen coin inside and turned the lock.
> Money really is important, isn’t it?
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: I said that it wasn’t supposed to be opened!
> I didn’t even want Koyomi to see that!
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: You’re really good at drawing.
> Not to mention, that story was amazing.
> What was with that hypocritical, diabetes-inducing romcom?
> What is this, the 80’s?
> As if a guy like that could exist in the real world.
> Ridiculous.
> To top it all off, the developments in it were rather lewd.
> I was overwhelmed by how much research you’d put into the premise, too.
> But well, I think you went overboard.
> I think it’d appeal to a lot more people if you streamlined it a bit more.
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Y-You’re dead.
> Dead!  Dead!  Dead!
> I’ll kill you and then kill myself!
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki]’s thoughts: Kill, huh?
> So you finally give me the time of day.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Killing me won’t achieve anything.
> Did the thought never come to you?
> Sure, your parents may dote on you with everything they’ve got,
> but if you stay missing for much longer,
> they’ll eventually open that closet of yours.
> Though, well, if you quit being a god right now, turn back into a human, and go back to your room,
> you might be able to easily dispose of that stuff yourself.
> If people seeing it embarrasses you that much—
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Screw you!
> As if I could quit being a god for such a stupid reason!
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: “For such a stupid reason”, eh?
> Then… what would be… reason enough… for you to quit being a god?
> No matter who I spoke to – Senjougahara, Hanekawa, and even your own parents –
> they never knew you had such a hobby.
> That’s how tightly you kept that embarrassing work a secret.
> You didn’t tell anyone.
> Wasn’t it because that was your real dream?
>
> Scene: Dream
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: When one truly wishes for something, they don’t tell people about it – not even God.
> I bet you’re happy as a god.
> I bet you’re having fun.
> But you didn’t want to become a god, right?
> Even waiting for six months has you so bored that you got hooked on cat’s cradle,
> so what on earth will you do after you’ve killed Araragi and friends?
> Happy as you may be, you’re nothing but a guard who has to watch this shrine rot away with time.
> How unfortunate.
> It’s not like you wanted to become a god, or wanted to be happy.
> You wanted to become a manga artist, right?
> Then why don’t you?
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: A-Are you stupid?
> Those are just doodles.
> I only don’t want people to see them because of how embarrassingly bad they are.
> My dream?
> Don’t be ridiculous!
> They’re just trash!
> I only hid them because I was too ashamed to throw them away, as much as I wanted to!
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Don’t speak of your own creations like that, Sengoku.
> Literary creations are inherently embarrassing.
> Dreams aren’t much different.
> Nothing can be done about it.
> It is what it is.
> But at the very least, you’re not supposed to deride them yourself.
> You’re so good at it, too.
> Maybe you’re just, as they say, a natural.
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Of course not!
> Besides, a manga artist isn’t something you can become just by having the desire.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: But if you don’t even have the desire, you’ll _never_ become one!
> It’s not like how you’re happy just because you’re a god.
> Being a god also prevents you from becoming one.
> So you have to be human.
> Sengoku, I love money!
> You know why?
> Because money can replace everything.
> - It lets you buy things.
> - It lets you buy lives.
> - It lets you buy people.
> - It lets you buy hearts.
> - It lets you buy happiness.
> - It lets you buy dreams.
> I love money because it’s so important, and yet not irreplaceable.
> So looking at it the other way around, I hate irreplaceable things.
> - “I can’t live without this.”
> - “That’s the only reason I’m alive.”
> - “That’s my only purpose in life.”
> Things that have scarcity value like that piss me off the most.
> Does being rejected by Araragi make you completely worthless?
> Does that ruin everything you wanted to do?
> Is that all your life amounted to?
> Hey, Sengoku…
> There’s a fool out there who’s saying she’ll take the tiresome role of being Araragi’s girlfriend.
> So put an end to that tiresome desire of yours, and do something else that’s equally as tiresome.
> Don’t you have plenty of other things that you wanted, or wanted to do?
> Didn’t you?
> Am I wrong?
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Things that I want?  Things I want to do?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Hey, Sengoku.
> Did you consider everything except Araragi worthless?
> Did you not love those upstanding citizens you called your parents?
> In your priorities, is everything except Araragi trash?
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: No.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Then, why?
> Why do you give him special treatment?
> Is he another part of yourself or something?
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Don’t act like you understand everything!
> You don’t know anything about me.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: I did my research.
> But you’re right.
> I don’t know a thing.
> I don’t know about anything that matters.
> You’re the only one who knows everything about yourself.
> So you’re the only one who can truly value yourself.
> And you’re the only one who can make your dreams come true.
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: That’s so fickle…
> Turning your attention to something else just because one thing didn’t work out.
> Is it really okay for humans to be like that?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: It is.  We’re only human, after all.
> Nothing in this world is irreplaceable.
> The girl I know – the girl I know well – acts like the love she’s in at any given moment is her first love.
> It’s like she’s always in the moment where she truly fell in love for the first time.
> And that’s how it’s supposed to be.
> It shouldn’t be any other way.
> “The only one” doesn’t exist.  Everything can be replaced.
> Humans, because they’re only human, can always start over from scratch.
> They can always buy something new.
> For now… take the money I gave you and go buy some proper drawing tools.
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Look, I don’t really…
> I’ve never thought about becoming a manga artist.
> And while I never wanted to be a god,
> I was lucky enough to become one.
> I think throwing that away would be a waste.
> But…
> There was a manga artist people called “God”, wasn’t there?
> I could just be like him, right?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Yeah, I’m sure you’ll be able to pull it off.
> Give it a shot, thinking I deceived you into it.
>
> [Nadeko Sengoku][]: Fine.
> I’ll let you deceive me.

> If you think no one is bothered by it, you’re wrong.
> Because at the very least, it bothers _you_.

> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Hey, Senjougahara.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: What is it?
> I assume the problems you had earlier are resolved if you’re calling me now.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Not really.
> Sorry.
> I just had to call you.
> I felt alone.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: I see.
> Well, I’ll take care of Hanekawa.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: What happened to her?
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: Kanbaru didn’t tell you?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Tell me what?
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: Just ask Hanekawa yourself once she’s home, I guess.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Hey, Senjougahara.
> There’s something I want to know.
> One year ago, when Kanbaru transferred into Naoetsu High School to see you…
> What did you think of it?
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: Well…
> Frankly, I thought it was a bit of a burden.
> The strength of her feelings, I mean.
> Conversely, you can think of it as proof that I was too shallow to appreciate her back then.
> Being with her would have required me to be a better person.
> I’m working on that, even now.
> I still labor away
> to become worthy enough to be your bride.
>
> Scene: Phone
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: Is that a burden for you?
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: No, not at all.
>
> […]
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: This might be our last chance, so can I ask you something that might upset you?
>
> Scene: Phone
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: What would you do if someone confessed to you who was a better match than me?
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: I’d switch to him ten times out of ten.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: You’re amazing…
> Amazingly blunt.
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: There are no absolutes in human relationships.
> I learned that from watching my parents.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Senjougahara, what I meant was—
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: I’m actually a little scared when I try to imagine an unconditional bond.
> I suggest you take this as encouragement to work on yourself so that I won’t think of leaving.
> You will never be special, but you can be special in the eyes of someone else.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Special in the eyes of someone else…
>
> Scene: Phone
>
> [Hitagi Senjougahara][]: I toil incessantly to be special in the eyes of you and Kanbaru.
> Don’t be afraid, Araragi.
> You are special
> in my eyes and Kanbaru’s.
> In Shinobu’s too.
> _We chose you._
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: You realized what I was getting at.
> Amazing.
>
> Scene: Phone

>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Kanbaru is really taking after you, huh?

> [Koyomi Araragi]’s voice-over: Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: The power to read the wind, the power to raise the wind.
> I don’t have anything like that.
> Although, it’s possible that that’s a lie.
> However, if you ask me, the power to read the wind isn’t very important in the first place,
> because for pandemics, a windless condition is of most importance.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Windless?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: When something’s popular,
> it means that something else isn’t popular.
> About this town specifically, I couldn’t lay a hand here during spring break.
> Because the gossip about the “vampire” was sweeping over.
> So once that rumor died out in a completely empty location,
> in a location that was starving, I plunged in my own rumors.
> Ghost stories, street gossip, urban legends.
> When the human heart is in disarray, these baseless rumors run rampant.
> When I say the human heart is in disarray, basically, there isn’t anything to rely on.
> Think about what kind of lame ducks a con man might want to target.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi]’s thoughts: I don’t even want to consider such things.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: That would be…
> The wealthy, right?
> Don’t they go for the rich?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki]’s thoughts: A virtuous peron’s way of thinking.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Someone who is already satisfied is hard to deceive.
> Humans with a surplus in their lives are humans with a surplus in their hearts.
> That’s why the people that con men target are the dissatisfied,
> the humans without a surplus in their hearts.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: That’s why, when you came to this town, you went for the middle school girls?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: I suppose.  Hearts filled with anxiety are easy to deceive.
> Because if they’re then filled up with lies, they don’t have the means to verify them.
> You said that for my plan, I spread “charms” to cause the deterioration of human relations.
> But it’s actually the opposite.
> Because human relations were deteriorating, everyone jumped for my “charms”.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Are you saying it’s their fault for being tricked?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: When you say it like that, I want to agree.
> Perhaps I should just say that the generation was bad.
> “Why is something like this so popular?”
> If you want to discuss a chaotic state like that,
> you should first discuss the void before the chaos.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi][]: Void?
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: The darkness, one might say.
> That’s why I’ll give you this piece of advice:
> If “something completely incomprehensible” starts getting popular,
> doubt your generation.
> Consider that something might be very wrong.
> That’s because the generation has been enveloped by darkness.
>
> [Koyomi Araragi]’s introspection: Enveloped by darkness.
>
> [Deishuu Kaiki][]: Now, Araragi.
> Now that I’ve taught you a very important trade secret of mine,
> why don’t I accept a fee from you?
> My guess is that the money you keep for a crucial moment is in your jacket’s inside pocket.
