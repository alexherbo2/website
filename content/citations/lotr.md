> [Galadriel]’s voice-over: The world is changed.  Much that once was is lost,
> for none now live who remember it.

> Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,  
> Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,  
> Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,  
> One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne  
> In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.  
> One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,  
> One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them  
> In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

> [Frodo Baggins][]: You’re late.
>
> [Gandalf][]: A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.  Nor is he early.
> He arrives precisely when he means to.
